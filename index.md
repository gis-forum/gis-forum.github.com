We are a group of GIS users who have come together as a community of practice.  Please feel free to email the forum at <a class="Contact the project" href="mailto:gis_forum@alliance.anu.edu.au">the group email list</a>. All GIS questions or comments are welcomed.
We focus on the following 5 themes:
1. Data Aquisition
2. Data Management
3. Data Analysis
4. Training
5. Communication

The forum meets TUESDAYS at 1-2pm at the Australian National University in Canberra, usually in <a href="https://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?msid=206677293162317563347.0004842ac865835d293a2&msa=0>
