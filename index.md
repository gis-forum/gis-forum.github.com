We are a group of GIS users who have come together as a community of practice.  Please feel free to email the forum at <a class="Contact the project" href="mailto:ivan.hanigan@canberra.edu.au">the group email list</a>. All GIS questions or comments are welcomed.
We focus on the following 5 themes:

1. Data Aquisition
2. Data Management
3. Data Analysis
4. Training
5. Communication

The forum meets ad hoc at the Australian National University in Canberra, usually in room F2 of the old Forestry Building (48) - or at the little pickle cafe.
