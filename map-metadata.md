The map shows the GIS forum's favourite meeting places as green crosses (geocoded using the GoogleMaps API), overlaying the suburb of Acton (from the 1981 census just for kicks), displayed over a google base layer.  The polygon of Acton is actually termed "Census Local Government Areas" (LGA) even though the ACT doesn't have LGAs.  To reflect this it is labelled as SLG in the original filename (but interestingly as LGA in the attribute table).
